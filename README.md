# Restaurant Name Generator

A simple Streamlit app that generates restaurant names and menu items based on the selected cuisine using the LangChain framework.

## Description

The Restaurant Name Generator is a Streamlit app that utilizes the LangChain framework to generate unique restaurant names and menu items for various cuisines. The app presents a user interface where users can select a cuisine, and the app will provide a restaurant name along with a list of menu items.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed. If not, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required Python libraries using the following commands:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   pip install `langchain`  # You might need to replace this with the actual LangChain library
   pip install `openai` 
   Replace `openai_key`` in `secret_key.py`:
    Replace the value of `openai_key` with your own OpenAI API key.


3. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
    `streamlit run main.py`

4. A browser window will open with the app interface. Select a cuisine from the sidebar, and the app will generate a restaurant name and menu items for that cuisine. 

## Dependencies 
    1. Streamlit: The web framework used to create the user interface.
    2. LangChain: The framework used to generate restaurant names and menu items based on given criteria. (Replace with the actual URL if LangChain has a separate documentation website.)
